# AIScanner
First AI project to use OpenCV to scan a receipt that will return a clear image with all the important information from that receipt. I will also use this to document the process.

Introduction
Problem: detect image and only retain the important information in an image

WorkFlow: image processing using OpenCV. No Model training, only libraries.

Tools & Framewroks: Python, matplotlib, numpy, TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda (virtual environment), OpenCV

Learning Outcomes: different formats and functions that are built-in that can be used foe edge detection
